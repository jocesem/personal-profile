        <h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
          <p>Ever since childhood, I've been intrigued by nature. I have vivid memories of excluding myself from my peers during elementary recess so I could collect leaves, twigs, and dirt and throw them into the large, hollowed out tree stump behind the playground. I would use a large stick to mix the earthy materials and get lost fantasizing about concocting my own medicinal recipes.</p>
          <p>This passion has grown stronger into adulthood and has gradually become the driving force behind my lifestyle and the kind of career I intend on pursuing.</p>
          <p>It was after I traveled throughout America twice, submerging myself in all of natures wonderful colors and exploring the profound beauty around me, that I found motivation to bring my passion to life via creative expression through web development.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Goals</h2>
          <p>I intend on becoming an avid herb forager so I can concoct my own medicinal recipes, create a holistic, non-toxic skincare line, and use my web development skills to start my own holistic, non-toxic skincare business.</p>
          <p>A key process to bring my passion to fruition is to master the process of building websites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
            <ul class="skills">
              <li>HTML</li>
              <li>CSS</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
          <p>To gain experience before starting my own business, I’d like to work for a holistic, non-toxic skincare company both as a product innovator and a valuable member of their web development team; learning innovation and marketing are both practical skills for starting my own business.</p>
